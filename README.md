Hardware: Cortex A53 (Quad Core)

Attempt to define maximum processor loading by simulating loads with consistently poor efficiency.
Selection Sort was chosen due to its best / worst / average time being O(N^2)

This is not an attempt to compare different architectures, the goal is to determine what maximum processor loads centered around a quantum of one second.
